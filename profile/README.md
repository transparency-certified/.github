The TRACE project is addressing challenges in trusting and verifying the results of computational research. The integrity of results is uncertain when their lineage or production cannot be validated, but verification through repeating executions is expensive and inefficient -- when possible. TRACE is developing a model of *certified transparency* whereby the original execution of a computational workflow is certified by the system on which they were run.  

Funding for the project is provided by the National Science Foundation under grants [2209629](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2209629&HistoricalAwards=false), [2209630](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2209630&HistoricalAwards=false),  and [2209628](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2209628&HistoricalAwards=false).
